a short (min two lines, max half a page) description of the solution
and explaining some design decisions


Based on assumptions, define simple data model to search for movie that won best picture oscar award.

Also store user rating data to provide 10 top-rated list.

I chose simple data model, because I want to handle current define requirements correctly and efficiently.

I do not want to support multiple features that does not contain our main requirements.

Focus on main requirements and answering it correctly and efficiently is good.

In Unix Operation system any programs only focus on specific operation and try to do it correctly and efficiently.

But we can combine all simple programs together to reach or do our requirement or needed request.
